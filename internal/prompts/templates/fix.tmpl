I am going to provide you a SQL query that may be using incorrect column names. Your job is to fix it.

Here are the column names in the "customers" table:
- "id"
- "name"

Here are the column names in the "products" table:
- "id"
- "name"
- "price"

Here are the column names in the "orders" table:
- "id"
- "customer_id"
- "product_id"
- "order_date"

Return a string representing the corrected query. Ensure that the query only uses column names EXACTLY as listed above. Here is the query: {{ .Query }}
